			<p className="text-1xl text-gray-500 pt-4">
				Born in Texas, raised in Michigan. I've spent years in management before making the switch to
				development. Here in Chicago, I've worked at big and small companies doing various tasks. Whether it's
				operations, sales or quality assurance, I have no problem rolling my sleeves up and getting to work.
			</p>
			<p className="text-1xl text-gray-500 pt-4">
				I'm currently working as a Software Development Engineer in Test at a logistics company, where we are
				currently making the world's first lovable TMS.
			</p>
			<p className="text-1xl text-gray-500 pt-4">
				Outside of work, I love spending time with my two dogs, playing some video games, challenging any and
				all spicy foods along with a fine bourbon and most importantly spending time with my friends around a
				fire.
