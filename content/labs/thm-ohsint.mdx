> **disclaimer** — this post uses **only publicly available information** from a training room. sensitive details are **masked** to avoid sharing personally identifiable information. methods shown are for **educational** purposes.

## briefing

- **room:** OHsint (TryHackMe)
- **goal:** use public info to answer 7 questions about a subject.
- **artifact provided:** `WindowsXP.jpg`

## plan of attack

1. **metadata** → `exiftool WindowsXP.jpg` to enumerate EXIF/IPTC/XMP fields.  
2. **handle pivot** → search the discovered handle across X (twitter), wordpress, github.  
3. **network breadcrumbs** → parse posts for **BSSID**; look up on **WiGLE** to infer **city** + **SSID**.  
4. **identity** → pull **email** from public repos or profile pages.  
5. **content mining** → review blog/posts for travel or other personal hints.  
6. **source review** → inspect page **source** for accidental secrets (inline JS, commented creds).  

## tools used

- `exiftool` for metadata
- web search (exact-handle queries)
- WiGLE (BSSID → geolocation / SSID)
- browser dev tools (“view source”)

## step-by-step (sanitized)

### 1) extract metadata

```bash
exiftool WindowsXP.jpg | tee exif.txt
```

look for fields like **Artist/Creator/Copyright** that can disclose a unique **handle**.

<details><summary>hint: where the handle is</summary>
the handle appears in a copyright/creator-like field. use it as your primary pivot.
</details>

### 2) pivot on the handle

- search the handle on X (twitter), wordpress, github.  
- confirm the same person by cross-referencing avatar, bio, or linked sites.

<details><summary>answer: avatar</summary>
the X (twitter) **avatar** is a **cat**.
</details>

### 3) mine posts for network clues

on the X profile, note a posted **BSSID** (AP MAC). query it on **WiGLE** to resolve **city** and **SSID**.

```text
wigle tips
- use "search" → "basic" → BSSID (MAC)
- a free account may be required to view results
```

<details><summary>answers: city + SSID (masked)</summary>
**city:** L****** (greater metro area)  
**SSID:** U********WiFi
</details>

### 4) find a personal email

pivot to the subject’s **github** or personal site; look for an email in repo metadata, README, or commit history.

<details><summary>answers: email + where found (masked)</summary>
**email:** O*********@g****.com  
**found on:** github
</details>

### 5) confirm travel / holiday

scan posts or blog entries for recent **travel** mentions.

<details><summary>answer: holiday location (masked)</summary>
**location:** N** Y***
</details>

### 6) inspect page source for leaks

open the personal site → **view source** and search for likely secret patterns (e.g., password-like strings).

<details><summary>answer: exposed password (masked)</summary>
`p****YDr0****.!`
</details>

## command snippets

```bash
# 1) EXIF/metadata
exiftool WindowsXP.jpg | tee exif.txt

# 2) fast handle pivots (replace <handle>)
# X (twitter) profile
open "https://x.com/<handle>"
# GitHub code search
open "https://github.com/search?q=<handle>"
# WordPress author archive (if seen)
open "https://wordpress.com/search?q=<handle>"

# 3) WiGLE BSSID lookup (replace with observed BSSID)
open "https://wigle.net"

# 4) source-code scan on a personal site
# mac
open -a "Google Chrome" "view-source:https://<site>"
# linux
xdg-open "view-source:https://<site>"
```

## ethics & ops (the short version)

- public stuff only — no logins, no scraped dumps, no work data. if it isn’t already on the open internet, i don’t use it.
- keep people out of the blast radius — blur emails, trim bssids/addresses, crop faces.
- no naming-and-shaming — don’t name real folks/companies unless they’ve said it’s ok; call them “the subject.”
- don’t hoard pii — grab what i need to learn, toss the rest.
- this is training content, not targeting guidance.
