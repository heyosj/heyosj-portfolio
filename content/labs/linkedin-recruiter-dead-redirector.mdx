## Identity Drift: Engineer → QA → Recruiter

![linkedin-dm-screenshot](/images/linkedin-recruiter-dead-redirector/dm.png)

## What This Is

I got a LinkedIn DM from someone claiming to be a recruiter with “opportunities near me.” They sent **six** short links, all on the same domain.

What caught my eye was the profile itself. It felt like three different people glued together.

### Why It Looked Off

**Red flag 1: The headline.** It was a wall of software engineering keywords. Not “recruiter,” not “talent,” just buzzwords stacked like someone was trying to show up in searches.

![recruiter-headline](/images/linkedin-recruiter-dead-redirector/recruiter-headline.png)

**Red flag 2: The About section.** It read like someone applying for a QA job. Generic “aspiring for a challenging job” language and awkward phrasing that didn’t match someone recruiting for roles.

![about-section](/images/linkedin-recruiter-dead-redirector/about-section.png)

**Red flag 3: Current role.** The current job listed was a booking clerk. Not recruiting. Not tech. Not even adjacent.

So I treated it like a mini incident and did safe link triage.

**Context:** Unsolicited DM with six short links. The profile context was mismatched across headline, about section, and current job.

**Safety constraints**
* No browser interaction with landing pages
* No JavaScript execution
* Headers only inspection via `curl -I`
* Preserve evidence even if the links are already dead

**Reality check:** By the time I looked, the redirect chain was already dead (404s and parked behavior). That does not make it useless. You can still capture indicators, document patterns, and preserve evidence for next time.

---

## Environment

**Setup**
* Host: macOS
* Analysis VM: Kali Linux (VirtualBox, NAT)
* Evidence folder: `~/linkedin-recruiter/`
* Link status: dead at time of analysis

**Why investigate dead links?** Because this stuff repeats. Different domain, same move. Having a baseline makes the next one faster.

---

## 1. Save The Links (Defanged)

First step: capture what you have without making anything clickable.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/linkedin-recruiter && cd ~/linkedin-recruiter

cat > urls.txt << 'EOF'
hxxps://usatalent[.]site/stjj
hxxps://usatalent[.]site/1ppi
hxxps://usatalent[.]site/0m1e
hxxps://usatalent[.]site/igcm
hxxps://usatalent[.]site/bpmx
hxxps://usatalent[.]site/fyji
EOF
```

**Pattern:** same domain, same token length, multiple links in one message. This is not normal recruiting behavior.

---

## 2. DNS Sanity Check (Passive)

Before touching the links, see what DNS says.

```bash
domain="usatalent.site"

dig +short A "$domain"   | tee -a dns_enum.txt
dig +short AAAA "$domain" | tee -a dns_enum.txt
dig +short NS "$domain"  | tee -a dns_enum.txt
```

If the domain does not resolve, you are done fast. If it does resolve, keep going.

---

## 3. Capture Redirect Headers (Headers Only)

This is the core workflow. Follow redirects without rendering anything.

```bash
# Start a timestamped transcript
script -q -t 2>terminal_timing.txt terminal_transcript.txt

# Follow redirects (HEAD only)
while read -r u; do
  real="$(echo "$u" | sed -E 's#^hxxp(s?)://#http\1://#; s/\[\.\]/\./g')"
  echo -e "\n===== $u =====" | tee -a headers.txt
  curl -sSIL --max-time 15 --max-redirs 10 "$real"     | sed -n '1,60p'     | tee -a headers.txt
done < urls.txt

exit
```

**Result:** all six links returned 404s or empty responses. The campaign was dead by the time I checked, but the evidence trail is captured.

---

## 4. Quick Tech Fingerprint (Still Passive)

If the domain responds at all, grab basic fingerprints. No crawling, no interaction.

```bash
whatweb -a 3 "https://usatalent.site" | tee -a facts.txt
```

In my case, the behavior looked like a WordPress site with short link mechanics.

---

## 5. Preserve Evidence (Hash + Bundle)

Hash everything, then bundle it into one portable archive.

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0   | xargs -0 sha256sum   | tee evidence_backup_SHA256.txt

tar -czf "evidence_backup_12212025.tar.gz"   dns_enum.txt headers.txt urls.txt facts.txt   terminal_transcript.txt terminal_timing.txt   evidence_backup_SHA256.txt
```

---

## 6. Copy Evidence Out (VM → Host)

If you use a VirtualBox shared folder:

```bash
cp evidence_backup_*.tar.gz /media/sf_VMShare/
cp evidence_backup_SHA256.txt /media/sf_VMShare/
```

Now you can shut down the VM and still have everything you need for a write up.

---

## Findings

**What I can say confidently**
* Multiple short links from the same domain in one DM
* Domain behavior looked dead or parked during analysis
* WordPress style short link behavior (common in disposable redirect infrastructure)
* Profile context mismatch: engineering headline, QA style about section, unrelated current role

**What I cannot prove (because the chain was dead)**
* Final landing behavior
* Full redirect chain during active campaign
* Whether it was credential harvest, malware delivery, or just data collection

**MITRE ATT&CK mapping (high level)**
* T1566.002 Spearphishing Link
* T1583.001 Acquire Infrastructure
* T1598.003 Spearphishing via Service (LinkedIn)

---

## If This Hit Production

**Block**
* `usatalent[.]site` at DNS or proxy
* Flag messages with 3+ short links from the same domain (low effort, decent signal)

**Hunt**
* Search proxy logs for `usatalent.site`
* Check if the same domain shows up in email or other messaging platforms

**Detect**
* Alert on short link patterns in external messages, especially multiple in one thread
* Add “profile mismatch” as an analyst note, not a detection rule

---

## What I Would Do Next Time

* Screenshot the entire profile early (before it disappears)
* Check historical context on VirusTotal, urlscan, archive.org
* Automate: defang + HEAD follow + IOC summary into a single script

---

## Key Takeaways

* Multiple short links from the same domain in a single DM is a big red flag
* Profile context matters: headline, about section, and current role should line up
* Dead links can still be worth documenting for patterns and repeatability
* HEAD requests get you what you need without touching the content
