## TL;DR

I got unsolicited SMS messages claiming to be from CoreBridge Recruitment, offering remote roles with unusually high pay for minimal work. After engaging, I was sent to a Songtrust branded login page that did not authenticate users. Clicking Sign in just redirected me to Telegram, where the scam moves to manual chat.

## 1) SMS lure

The pitch was classic. Low effort, high pay, and generic eligibility checks.

## 2) Fake Songtrust “portal”

The link pointed to:

* `work[.]songtrustppc[.]com/login`

The page uses Songtrust branding and marketing language instead of an actual authentication form.

<figure className="my-8 mx-auto max-w-md sm:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl rounded-2xl border border-white/10 bg-black/20 shadow-[0_24px_80px_rgba(0,0,0,0.55)] overflow-hidden">

    src="/images/employment-scam/homepage.png"
    alt="Songtrust-branded landing page posing as a login portal"
    className="h-auto w-full max-h-[640px] object-contain"
    width="2426"
    height="1546"
  />
  <figcaption className="p-3 text-center text-sm text-white/70">Songtrust landing page — branding and marketing language replace a real login.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Static inspection

* No visible login form
* No backend auth endpoints referenced
* No credential submission on page load

The `/login` path is misleading and functions as a landing page, not an auth page.

## 3) Redirect to Telegram

Clicking Sign in does not authenticate the user. It redirects to Telegram.

`t[.]me/SONGTRUST_01`

<figure className="my-8 mx-auto max-w-md sm:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl rounded-2xl border border-white/10 bg-black/20 shadow-[0_24px_80px_rgba(0,0,0,0.55)] overflow-hidden">
  <img
    src="/images/employment-scam/redirect.png"
    alt="Redirect from the fake portal to a Telegram handle"
    className="h-auto w-full max-h-[640px] object-contain"
    width="2426"
    height="1546"
  />
  <figcaption className="p-3 text-center text-sm text-white/70">Telegram redirect — the flow moves off-platform into chat.</figcaption>
</figure>

This confirms the site’s role as a traffic funnel. All meaningful interaction moves off platform to Telegram, where the scam is handled manually with screenshots, instructions, and next steps.

## What this campaign relies on

* Brand impersonation using Songtrust
* Social engineering via SMS
* Off platform migration to Telegram
* Human in the loop fraud

No malware, payloads, or credential harvesting endpoints were observed.

## Takeaway

This was clearly a scam from the first message. The pitch was vague, the pay unrealistic, and the outreach unsolicited. I continued the conversation intentionally — not because it was convincing, but to observe how the flow worked. When I pushed back (asking about a sign-on bonus), the tone immediately shifted to defensiveness and gaslighting, a common tactic used to reassert legitimacy and keep victims engaged.

The site itself did nothing malicious. Its only purpose was to redirect the conversation to Telegram, where the scam is executed manually.
