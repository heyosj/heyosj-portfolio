> **TL;DR** — TLS-RPT lets you receive aggregate reports about STARTTLS and policy failures so you can catch transport misconfigurations (expired certs, hostname mismatches, missing STARTTLS, bad MTA-STS/DANE) early.

## what it is

**SMTP TLS reporting (TLS-RPT)** lets a domain publish an address where aggregate summaries of TLS negotiation success/failure should be sent.

## why it matters

reports surface issues that break or weaken secure mail transport:
- invalid/expired certificates, hostname mismatches, or no STARTTLS support.
- problems with mta-sts policies, DANE/TLSA records, or policy retrieval.

without TLS-RPT, when TLS handshakes fail, the sending MTA generally can’t notify you about transport problems.

## minimum viable enablement

1. publish a DNS TXT record advertising your TLS-RPT report address (rua).
2. choose delivery: email mailbox and/or HTTPS POST endpoint (you can set multiple).
3. expect JSON aggregates; using a third-party parser can make review easier.

### example DNS record

```txt
_smtp._tls.example.com. 3600 IN TXT "v=TLSRPTv1; rua=mailto:tlsrpt@example.com,https://reports.example.com/tlsrpt"
```

> replace `example.com` and the mailbox/URL with your real domain and destination. keep TTL reasonable (e.g., 3600) while testing.
