# Notes: Azure + Colima Forensics Setup

Iâ€™ve been trying to get my head around what cloud forensics looks like, especially in Azure. At first I was mixing up Docker, Colima, and VMs â€” didnâ€™t know why Iâ€™d need them if Iâ€™m already in the cloud. Hereâ€™s how I sorted it out in my head.

---

## Azure = the crime scene

- Incidents actually happen in Azure (VMs, identities, logs).
- Evidence lives there: activity logs, NSG flow logs, VM snapshots (VHDs), maybe memory dumps.
- The point is: Azure holds the data I need when something suspicious happens.

---

## Colima = my toolbox

- Docker runs apps inside containers (self-contained, clean, throwaway).
- Colima is what makes Docker work on my Mac (since macOS canâ€™t do it natively).
- This means I donâ€™t have to clutter my laptop installing forensic tools. I just spin up a container, use it, then shut it down.

---

## Containers vs VMs (the way it clicked for me)

- VM = a whole house (heavy, its own OS).
- Container = just an apartment (lighter, shares the foundation).
- Colima = the property manager that makes apartments possible on macOS.

That analogy helped me finally stop confusing them.

---

## Simple workflow (how I picture it)

1. Something bad happens in Azure â†’ export artifacts.
2. On my Mac, start Colima â†’ run a container with the tools I need.
3. Analyze the evidence locally (logs, snapshots, memory, network traffic).

So basically:

ðŸ‘‰ Azure = crime scene  
ðŸ‘‰ Colima/Docker = my portable lab bench

## Technical Steps (Baseline Setup)

1. **Create an Azure account**  
   - Sign up at [azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free).  
   - If youâ€™re on school or work SSO, use a personal email so you can manage your own subscription.  

2. **Set a budget / spending cap**  
   - In the Azure Portal: `Cost Management + Billing â†’ Budgets`.  
   - Set alerts so you donâ€™t burn through free credits or overspend.  

3. **Install Colima (macOS/Linux)**  
   ```bash
   brew install colima
   ```  

4. **Start Colima**  
   ```bash
   colima start
   ```  

5. **Test Docker is working**  
   ```bash
   docker run hello-world
   ```

## Cheat Sheet (for daily use)

**Colima (engine)**  
```bash
colima start       # start the Docker VM
colima stop        # stop it to save resources
colima status      # check if it's running
```

**Containers**  
```bash
docker run hello-world          # run a quick test
docker run -it ubuntu bash      # drop into a container shell
docker ps                       # list running containers
docker stop <id>                # stop a container
docker rm <id>                  # remove a container
```

**Cleanup**  
```bash
docker system prune             # clean up unused stuff
```

## Notes on Tooling

- You donâ€™t reinstall tools every time.  
- **Images** = reusable toolboxes.  
- **Containers** = temporary work sessions.  
- Later I can either:  
  - Pull tool-specific images (fast start), or  
  - Build my own `forensics:baseline` image (uniform + reusable).  

That's my baseline mental model + quick reference for now.
