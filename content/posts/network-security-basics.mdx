## Why networking matters

- **Security Architecture & Engineering** — You design secure networks using segmentation, firewalls, DMZs, IDS/IPS, and more.
- **Security Operations (SecOps)** — Deep networking helps with packet analysis, incident response, forensics, and pentesting. Know OSI layers, TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, ARP, and how traffic actually flows.

## Basics

- **Web servers belong in a DMZ.** They’re reachable from the internet, so isolate them from internal assets and place controls between tiers.
- **Workstations should be on their own VLAN/subnet** and ideally have host-based firewall rules preventing lateral WS-to-WS traffic. Same flat segment as servers increases spoofing/MitM risk.
- **Switches/routers on an “admin network.”** Keeps users from snooping or tampering with infra plane traffic.
- **IP phones on a voice VLAN.** Avoid letting PCs eavesdrop.
- **Printers on their own segment.** They see sensitive docs and can trigger NTLM auth, which attackers can relay—also handy persistence spots.

> 💡 **Remote-first reality check:** If your apps live in cloud VPCs, the same patterns apply: public subnets (DMZ) for ingress, private subnets for app/data, and tightly scoped security groups/NACLs. Ask: *Is our “web tier” actually isolated?* 

## Network access: VPNs

**Remote Access VPN** creates a virtual interface on the client to reach internal networks. Route design matters:

- **Split tunnel** — Only specific routes (e.g., `10.10.10.0/24`) go through the VPN; everything else uses the local internet. Good for user privacy and bandwidth, **but** malware on the host can bypass network-based detections for non-tunneled traffic.

> 💡 With split tunneling, corp traffic is protected, personal traffic isn’t—an infected machine can still reach company subnets once connected.

## Proxies (L7 middleboxes)

A **proxy** mediates traffic and can inspect content (Layer 7). Without mediation/inspection it’s a **gateway**, not a proxy. VPNs ≠ proxies. 

- **Forward proxy** — Client asks the proxy to fetch outbound content.
- **Reverse proxy** — Fronts services and filters inbound requests; common place for **WAFs** to block malicious HTTP traffic. 

## Models: OSI vs. TCP/IP

- **OSI (7 layers)** — Conceptual reference for describing communication responsibilities.
- **TCP/IP (Internet Protocol Suite)** — Practical stack used on the internet. Think 4 layers that roughly map to OSI’s 7. In practice, you’ll speak in TCP/IP terms but use OSI for reasoning/teaching. 

## Packet flow & PDUs

Each layer wraps the data from the layer above in its own **header** (encapsulation). The receiver removes them in reverse (decapsulation). We call those per-layer units **Protocol Data Units (PDUs)**. 

## IP addressing (quick hits)

- **IPv4/IPv6** — Unique logical address for the host (like a street address).
- **MAC** — Link-layer hardware address (like the apartment number).

## Network segmentation & subnet masks

> 💡 Seeing `10.0.0.0/8` or other **very large** CIDRs often hints at weak segmentation. Prefer smaller subnets (e.g., `/24`) to limit lateral movement and blast radius.

**Subnet Masking Summary**

1. **What it does** — Splits an IP into **network** and **host** portions.
2. **Formats** — Dotted decimal `255.255.255.0` and CIDR `/24`.
3. **How it works** — `192.168.1.0/24` yields 256 addresses; `.0` is the network ID, `.255` broadcast.
4. **Key insight** — Larger subnets (`/8`, `/16`) mean more hosts on one segment → broader attack surface. Smaller subnets (`/24`) improve containment.
5. **Why SecOps cares** — Alerts tied to huge subnets may reflect misconfiguration; investigate re-segmentation to reduce risk.

### Subnetting

Splitting a larger address range into smaller ranges to control scope, performance, and security.
