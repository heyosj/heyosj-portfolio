> **TL;DR** — Simple Azure tenant + single subscription layout with two resource groups (`az500-study-rg` and `forensics-lab-rg`) and scoped roles for two lab users. Designed to support **AZ-500 study**, **forensics practice**, and be easy to grow or tear down.

# Azure Environment Structure (Current Notes)

I wanted a clean setup that works for both **AZ-500 studying** and building my **forensics lab**.  
Here’s how I structured it so far and why:

---

## Structure Overview

- **Tenant (Entra ID)**  
  The root of everything. Users, groups, and directory-level roles live here.

- **Subscription: Azure subscription 1**  
  Single subscription for now (the free trial upgraded if needed). All resources will live inside this.

- **Resource Groups**
  - `az500-study-rg` → For labs and exercises specific to AZ-500 material.
  - `forensics-lab-rg` → For my own sandbox to simulate incidents, collect evidence, and practice investigations.

- **Users**
  - `az500.user` → Analyst-style account for AZ-500 study.
  - `forensics.user` → Account to simulate analyst or attacker roles in the forensics lab.

- **Entra Roles (Tenant level)**  
  Both users have:
  - Security Reader (see risky sign-ins, alerts)
  - Reports Reader (view sign-in and audit logs)

- **Azure RBAC Roles (Subscription level)**  
  Both users have:
  - Reader  
  - Log Analytics Reader  
  - Security Reader  

Refresher:

- **Tenant-level roles (Entra)** → _directory-wide_, apply to all subscriptions under the tenant.  
- **RBAC roles (Azure)** → _scope-bound_, apply only where you assign them (sub, RG, resource).

## Why Structure It This Way?

- **Separation of Concerns**  
  Splitting resources into two groups (`az500-study-rg` and `forensics-lab-rg`) keeps experiments and study material clean. I can delete one RG without touching the other.

- **Clarity for Roles**  
  Assigning both Entra roles (identity-level visibility) and RBAC roles (resource-level visibility) makes test users realistic for security monitoring and forensics.

- **Foundation for Growth**  
  This structure scales easily. I can add more users, subscriptions, or resources without reworking the basics.

- **Portfolio-Ready**  
  The diagram helps me (and potentially employers) see that I understand Azure’s hierarchy: Tenant → Subscription → Resource Groups → Resources, with clear role assignments.

This is my baseline Azure environment setup before adding actual lab resources (VMs, storage accounts, Log Analytics).  
I'll expand this as I build the forensics side out (e.g., dedicated evidence storage, jump host, and simulated attacker/defender identities).
